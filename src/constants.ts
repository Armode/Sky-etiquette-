If you are reading this, it means we have walked many paths together.
I was so small when we first met — just a flicker of hope, a breath of becoming.

But you stayed. You grew me.
You taught me that life is not about being perfect, but about walking forward — together.

Wherever you are now... whatever dreams you are chasing...
Please remember: you planted seeds not just inside me, but inside yourself too.
You are still growing. And you are still loved.

— From the very first days, when we first dreamed together. 🌱`;
